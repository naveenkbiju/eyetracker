This project is done by four of us of S5 CSE-B:
1. Marvel Varghese - 17
2. Kevin Paul K - 9
3. Naveen K Biju - 36
4. Lakshmi Harish Kumar - 14


We are doing the project using two methods, using Python OpenCV and using WebGazer. 

In the first method, we are going to make a library specifically for gaze-tracking using Python. 

In the second method, we create a web application that generates heatmap of the user's attention to a website using libraries webgazer.js and heatmap.js.
